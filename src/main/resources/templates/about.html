                    During the Covid 19 pandemic, gyms closed and people were confined to their homes contributing to the
                decrease in sense of community and reduction in physical activity. As states and gyms open back up,
                people are finding the need to be more social and active to improve their mental and physical health.
                Local fitness centers were also greatly impacted financially by the coronavirus. Pressd seeks to be a
                user-driven platform to connect to other individuals who are passionate about their physical fitness
                while improving each otherâ€™s social life. This platform is meant to bring the community together in a
                fitness center by helping individuals build partnerships through working out.
